# FastSimNN
Instant simulation of detector responses using ML.
Unlike the traditional Geant4 and fast detector simulation programs,
this approach makes almost instant transformation (1-2 ms/event) of true-level Monte Carlo
record to a record that closely follows the full/fast detector simulation.
It uses an array of neural networks that need to be trained beforehand using true-level and
detector-level records.


# Now to run
The program is designed and compiled to run on the ANL ATLAS cluster.
You need to link it against Delphes. 

# Input of data
The inputs for this program are data from the HepSim repository (http://atlaswww.hep.anl.gov/hepsim/). 
The training is done using ttbar+jets and gamma+jet samples (weighted). This allows
tests of jets in the range (25 GeV -3 TeV), photons, muons and electrons.
